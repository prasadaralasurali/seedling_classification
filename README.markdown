In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been built to classify crop and weed species at seedling stage.

The details of the project is in file "project_report.pdf".

The code is in file "seedling_classification.ipynb".

The dataset has been downloaded from the link; 
https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset/ (file name; V1: Nonsegmented single plants (1.7GB)).

The dataset is released by the Aarhus University Signal Processing group in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark (Giselsson TM, JÃ¸rgensen RN, Jensen PK, Dyrmann M, Midtiby HS (2017) A Public Image Database for Benchmark of Plant Seedling Classification Algorithms. CoRR abs/1711.05458)
