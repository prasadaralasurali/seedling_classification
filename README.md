Nov 15, 2018

In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been built to classify crop and weed species at seedling stage.

The details of the project is in file "project_report.pdf".

The code is in file "seedling_classification.ipynb".

The dataset has been downloaded from the link; 
https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset/ (file name; V1: Nonsegmented single plants (1.7GB)).

The dataset is released by the Aarhus University Signal Processing group in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark (Giselsson TM, JÃ¸rgensen RN, Jensen PK, Dyrmann M, Midtiby HS (2017) A Public Image Database for Benchmark of Plant Seedling Classification Algorithms. CoRR abs/1711.05458) 

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries:

keras

tensorflow

time

glob

matplotlib

zipfile

os

sklearn

numpy 

pandas

cv2

PIL

**Note: this capstone proejct is a part of Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity**
